# Learning GitHub Basics

Welcome to my **learning** repository!  
This repo is where I practice the fundamental concepts of using GitHub as part of my development journey.  
It's not a production-ready project — it's a sandbox for experimenting, exploring, and learning.

## 1. What I Learned

Here’s what I’ve explored so far:

-  How to create a GitHub repository
-  How to upload files into the repo
-  How to create and switch between branches
-  Understanding how branches work with commits and merging
-  Writing and committing meaningful messages
-  Building habits for clean version control

## 2. Why This Repo Exists

I created this to track my progress as I get more comfortable using GitHub.  
Version control is a key skill in software development, and this repo is like my practice notebook for it.

## 3. What’s Next?

- Learn pull requests and code reviews
- Explore `.gitignore` and licensing
- Work with GitHub Issues and Projects
- Collaborate with others on test projects
